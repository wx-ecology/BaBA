Description: This package conducts barrier behavior analysis (BaBA) that identifies and classifies animal movement near linear barriers (e.g. fences, roads, railroads, pipelines, rivers, etc.) into one of the following categories: Bounce, Quick Cross, Back-and-forth, Trace, Trap, Average Movement and unknown. This information can be used to examine permeabilities of barriers to animal movement.
